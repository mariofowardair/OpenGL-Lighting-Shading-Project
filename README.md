Here is my lighting+shading project used with OpenGL, C++, vertex shaders, and fragment shaders. I utilized concepts like ambient shading, 
Lambertian shading, Phong shading, and the modern GPU rendering pipeline to create this project. Additionally, taking into 
account of linear transformation concepts such as the homogeneous coordinate system and affine matrices, I was able to implement this project
by transforming my mesh with necessary scaling, reflections, and rotations.
